# Hardware Design for the UAXSat IV Project

This document outlines the hardware design specifications for the microsatellite project at Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio. Our design is inspired by the standard 3U CubeSat structure but has been uniquely adapted to leverage the materials and manufacturing capabilities available at our university. 

The primary focus of this adaptation is the use of a Kevlar-Carbon laminate for the satellite's structural walls, offering a robust yet lightweight solution that meets our specific mission requirements. Additionally, we have extensively utilized 3D printing with PETG for manufacturing other critical parts of the satellite, ensuring precision and durability. Metal profiles are employed for attaching the walls, providing a secure and reliable framework for the satellite's structure. The design also incorporates custom mounting points for the payloads and instruments developed by our teams, enabling seamless integration and optimal performance

## Design Overview

The microsatellite's design adheres to the 3U CubeSat standard, with dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm. This standardization facilitates compatibility with a wide range of deployment mechanisms and space mission opportunities. However, our design diverges in its material choice for the satellite's structural components.

### Material Selection

The walls of the satellite are constructed from a high-strength Kevlar-Carbon laminate. This material was chosen for its exceptional properties:

- **Lightweight:** Critical for minimizing launch costs.
- **High Tensile Strength:** Ensures structural integrity under the stresses of launch and in the harsh conditions of space.
- **Thermal Stability:** Offers resistance to the extreme temperature variations encountered in orbit.
- **Radiation Resistance:** Provides protection against space's high-radiation environment, safeguarding onboard electronics.

### Manufacturing Process

Given the unique material choice, the manufacturing process has been tailored to the capabilities of Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio. The process involves:

1. **Laminate Layup:** Sheets of Kevlar and Carbon fiber are layered and impregnated with a resin to form the laminate.
2. **Curing:** The laminate is cured in a controlled environment to ensure optimal material properties.
3. **Precision Cutting:** Utilizing CNC machinery available at the university, the cured laminate is cut to precise dimensions for assembly.
4. **Assembly:** Components are assembled using aerospace-grade adhesives and fasteners, ensuring a secure and durable structure.

### Adaptations and Innovations

Our design incorporates several adaptations and innovations to optimize the microsatellite for its intended mission:

- **Custom Mounting Points:** Designed to accommodate the specific payloads and instruments developed by our research teams.
- **Thermal Management:** Integrated pathways for thermal conduction, utilizing the laminate's properties for efficient heat distribution.

## Conclusion

The microsatellite project at Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio represents a significant step forward in our space research capabilities. By adapting the standard 3U CubeSat design to our specific needs and resources, we have developed a satellite that is not only mission-ready but also showcases the innovative spirit of our university. We look forward to the contributions this project will make to the field of space research and the valuable hands-on experience it provides to our students.
